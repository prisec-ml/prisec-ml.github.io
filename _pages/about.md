Security beyond Defenses: Protecting DNN systems via Forensics and Recovery  
[[Recording]](https://youtu.be/20z4l824UG4)<details><br>**Abstract:** Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to numerous attacks, including inference time attacks based on adversarial perturbations, as well as training time attacks such as data poisoning. The security community has done extensive work to explore both attacks and defenses, only to produce a seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game. In this talk, I will talk about some of our recent work that seeks to extend security beyond attack and defense, focusing on forensics and recovery of deployed ML systems. I start by drawing parallels with other more established security areas and argue that defenses are often only a piece of the solution. I will talk about two additional aspects of security, post-attack forensics and recovery. I will present recent results from two papers in this space (Usenix Security and CCS 2022), where we explore the role of post-attack mitigation for improving DNN robustness against both poisoning attacks and adversarial examples. <br><br>**Bio:** Shawn Shan is a PhD student at the University of Chicago.

Strengthening and Enriching Machine Learning for Cybersecurity  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/JMO1YSSQKfY)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Nowadays, security researchers are increasingly using AI to automate and facilitate security analysis. Although making some meaningful progress, AI has not maximized its capability in security yet, mainly due to two challenges. First, existing ML techniques have not reached security professionals' requirements in critical properties, such as interpretability and adversary-resistancy. Second, Security data imposes many new technical challenges, and these challenges break the assumptions of existing ML models and thus jeopardize their efficacy. In this talk, I will describe my research efforts to address the above challenges, with a primary focus on strengthening the interpretability of ML-based security systems and enriching ML to handle low-quality labels in security data. I will describe our technique to robustify existing explanation methods against attacks and a novel explanation method for deep learning-based security systems. I will also demonstrate how security analysts could benefit from explanations to discover new knowledge and patch ML model vulnerabilities. Then, I will introduce a novel ML system to enable high accurate categorizations of low-quality attack data and demonstrate its utility in a real-world industrial-level application. Finally, I will conclude by highlighting my plan towards maximizing the capability of advanced ML in cybersecurity. <br><br>**Bio:** Wenbo Guo is a PostDoc.

Adversarial Exploration of Machine Learning Models' Accountability  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/rM3mjAgv2Q8)] <details><br>**Abstract:**  The increasing cost of training machine learning (ML) models has led to the inclusion of new parties to the training pipeline, such as users who contribute training data. This involvement of new parties in the ML training process has introduced new training time attack surfaces for an adversary to exploit. In this talk, we will discuss a new class of training time attacks, namely the model hijacking attack, whereby the adversary aims to hijack a target model to execute a different task than its original one. Model hijacking can cause accountability risks since a hijacked model's owner can be framed for having their model offer illegal or unethical services. First,  we will introduce the hijacking attack in simple settings where the hijacking and original tasks/data are of the same modality. Next, we will discuss how the model hijacking attack can be generalized to the multimodal setting.<br><br>**Bio:** Ahmed Salem is a post-doctoral researcher in the Confidential Computing group at Microsoft Research.

Some Recent Developments in Differentially Private Deep Learning  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFWtv81F7M8)]  <details><br>**Abstract:** Differentially private deep learning is the gold standard for privacy-preserving deep learning but has been reported to suffer from performance and efficiency issues. In this talk, I will present a series of works done with collaborators that improves the practicality and trustworthiness of methods in this space. We show that performant models can be trained with differential privacy on small datasets with publicly pretrained models and appropriate hyperparameters. We show that a form of per-layer clipping, when carefully implemented, results in private training workflows with computational efficiency approaching that of non-private training per epoch. Some of these techniques have seen initial adoption by product teams at Microsoft, e.g., for differentially private synthetic text generation. One common wisdom in private learning has been that large models tend to perform poorly when trained with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). This intuition is partly based on results in private convex optimization and seemingly contradicts our empirical findings. To resolve this, we study when the problem size adversely affects the performance of private learning. Theoretically, we show that DP-SGD can result in dimension-independent bounds (even when gradients span the entire ambient space) for unconstrained problems. Empirically, we show that gradients of language models obtained during fine-tuning are mostly controlled by a few principal components—-a behavior that is similar to conditions under which we obtain dimension-independent bounds for private convex learning. Prior works have identified that privacy guarantees come at a cost of other aspects of trustworthy machine learning. We show that differentially private training consistently produces models with over-confident predictions in practice, resulting in a privacy-calibration tradeoff. We show that this tradeoff can be addressed through differentially private variants of temperature scaling and Platt scaling. In the end, time permitting, we will discuss future directions in this space and the ethics of training on sensitive data.<br><br>**Bio:** Xuechen Li is a PhD student at Stanford CS developing techniques for trustworthy machine learning.

Interdisciplinary Research Yields New Insights: A Case-Study in Privacy & ML  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMXxfA3LmiM)] <details><br>**Abstract:** Machine learning has enabled innovations in a variety of areas. However, “privacy in machine learning” is still not well established and is an area of active research. In this talk, I will describe how we approach this problem by drawing insight from different areas in computer science. First, I will discuss how “more utilitarian” private data can be synthesized using generative models aided by causality. Next, I will attempt to shed more light on the efficacy of privacy attacks by connecting it to label memorization. Then, I will discuss how cryptography helps enable a new swarth of private ML applications. <br><br>**Bio:** Varun Chandrasekaran is a post-doctoral researcher in the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research.

Some Results on Privacy and Machine Unlearning  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcd_dzBWgQE)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Machine unlearning has received significant attention recently as a result of regulations promoting the "right to be forgotten". Recent work (Chen et al. 2021) has shown that machine unlearning can lead to easier membership inference attacks on deleted points. In this talk, I will discuss a couple other interesting privacy phenomena related to machine unlearning. First, I will discuss how deleting a record may make membership inference easier on other records, in the "privacy onion effect". Next, I will discuss how training on very large datasets can lead to "forgetting", and I will discuss the relationship between forgetting and machine unlearning. <br><br>**Bio:** Matthew is a research scientist at Google on the Brain Privacy and Security team.

Continuous Release of Data Streams under Differential Privacy  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhSDyF953X8)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Most differential privacy (DP) algorithms are designed to handle static data. Handling dynamic data with DP is a challenge. In this talk, I will summarize existing solusions towards dynamic data. As a special case, I will then talk into details about our recent CCS paper for publishing a stream of real-valued data satisfying DP. Here one major challenge is that the maximal possible value in the stream can be quite large, leading to enormous DP noise and bad utility. To overcome this problem, we use a commonly seen technique called truncation. Our idea is to find an optimal truncation parameter (approximately, satisfying DP) achieving a balance between bias and variance. I will present our complete solution which consists of (in addition to truncation) an online hierarchical method and a post-processing step. <br><br>**Bio:** Tianhao Wang is an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Virginia.

Unlocking High-Accuracy Differentially Private Image Classification through Scale  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tLbQ7-9wGE)]<details><br>**Abstract:**  Differential Privacy (DP) provides a formal privacy guarantee preventing adversaries with access to a machine learning model from extracting information about individual training points. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), the most popular DP training method, realizes this protection by injecting noise during training. However previous works have found that DP-SGD often leads to a significant degradation in performance on standard image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, some authors have postulated that DP-SGD inherently performs poorly on large models, since the norm of the noise required to preserve privacy is proportional to the model dimension. In this talk, we will describe our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13650) where we demonstrate that DP-SGD on over-parameterized models can perform significantly better than previously thought. Combining careful hyper-parameter tuning with simple techniques to ensure signal propagation and improve the convergence rate, we achieve 81.4% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 under (8, 10^(-5))-DP using a 40-layer Wide-ResNet, improving over the previous best result of 71.7%. When fine-tuning a pre-trained Normalizer-Free Network, we achieve 86.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet under (8, 8x10^(-7))-DP, markedly exceeding the previous best of 47.9% under a larger privacy budget of (10, 10^(-6))-DP.<br><br>**Bios:** Soham De is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind in London.

Adversarial Robustness via Forensics in Deep Neural Networks   
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NVpffuHnJI)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Despite their tangible impact on a wide range of real world applications, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to numerous attacks, including inference time attacks based on adversarial perturbations, as well as training time attacks such as backdoors. The security community has done extensive work to explore both attacks and defenses, only to produce a seemingly endless cat-and-mouse game. In this talk, I will talk about some of our recent work into digital forensics for DNNs. I start by summarizing some of our recent projects at UChicago SAND Lab covering both sides of the struggle, including honeypot defenses (CCS 2020) and physical domain poison attacks (CVPR 2021). Our  experiences in these projects motivated us to seek a more realistic view towards adversarial robustness for DNNs, beyond the current static, binary views of attack and defense. We take a more pragmatic view that given sufficient incentive and resources, attackers will eventually succeed in compromising DNN systems. Just as in traditional security realms, digital forensics tools can serve dual purposes: identifying the sources of the compromise so that they can be mitigated, while also providing a strong deterrent against future attackers.  I will present results from our first paper in this space (Usenix Security 2022), specifically addressing forensics for poisoning attacks against DNNs, and show how we can trace back corrupted models to specific subsets of training data responsible for the corruption. Our approach builds up on ideas from model unlearning, and succeeds with high precision/recall for both dirty- and clean-label attacks.<br><br>**Bio:** Ben Zhao is Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago.

Causal vs Associational Machine Learning: A Privacy Perspective  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/L9-PEkfNC1k)]<details><br>**Abstract:** In this talk, we will analyze two different learning paradigms from a privacy perspective: associational and causal machine learning. Associational models such as DNNs have been shown to rely on spurious features for prediction tasks and often fail to generalize when there is a slight change in the distribution of the spurious features. Moreover, their inability to generalize has been identified as a key reason for leaking sensitive information such as membership of training data points. In contrast, causal models have been shown to learn invariant features from the training dataset and have better generalization properties. The first part of the talk establishes a theoretical link between causality and privacy: compared to associational models, causal models provide stronger differential privacy guarantees and are more robust to membership inference attacks. The second part focuses on empirically validating the theoretical claims under different settings in practice: results demonstrate that causal learning can be a promising direction to balance the privacy-utility tradeoff in machine learning models.<br><br>**Bio:** Shruti is a senior researcher in the Confidential Computing group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK.

Secure Self-supervised Learning  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdMUuRG-cmA)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning has made revolutionary progress in the past several years and is commonly believed to be a promising approach for general-purpose AI. In particular, self-supervised learning aims to pre-train an encoder (also known as foundation model) using a large amount of unlabeled data. The pre-trained encoder is like an "operating system" of the AI ecosystem. Specifically, the encoder can be used as a general-purpose feature extractor for many downstream tasks with little or even no labeled training data. In this talk, we will discuss the security of pre-trained encoders. Studying the security of pre-trained encoders is like studying the operating-system-level security of AI. In the first part of this talk, we will show that an attacker can embed a backdoor into a pre-trained encoder, such that multiple downstream classifiers built based on the backdoored encoder inherit the backdoor behavior simultaneously. AI companies often use our public data on the Internet to pre-train encoders even if we didn't authorize them to do so. Therefore, in the second part of this talk, we will discuss a method to audit unauthorized data use in pre-training encoders.<br><br>**Bio:** Neil Gong is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Department of Computer Science (secondary appointment) at Duke University.

Scalable, Accurate, Robust Binary Analysis with Transfer Learning  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/j9ol3b3azD0)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Binary program analysis is a fundamental building block for a broad spectrum of security tasks. Essentially, binary analysis encapsulates a diverse set of tasks that aim to understand and analyze behaviors/semantics of binary programs. Existing approaches often tackle each analysis task independently and heavily employ ad-hoc task-specific brittle heuristics. While recent ML-based approaches have shown some early promise, they too tend to learn spurious features and overfit to specific tasks without understanding the underlying program semantics.<br>In this talk, I will describe some of our recent projects that use transfer learning on both binary code and execution traces to learn binary program semantics and transfer the learned knowledge for different binary analysis tasks. Our key observation is that by designing pretraining tasks that can learn binary code semantics, we can drastically boost the performance of binary analysis tasks. Our pretraining tasks are fully self-supervised &ndash; they do not need expensive labeling effort and therefore can easily generalize across different architectures, operating systems, compilers, optimizations, and obfuscations. Extensive experiments show that our approach drastically improves the performance of popular tasks like binary disassembly, matching semantically similar binary functions, and recovering types from binary.<br><br>**Bio:** Suman Jana is an associate professor in the department of computer science and the data science institute at Columbia University.

From average-case to worst-case privacy leakage in neural networks  
[[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44kTB1EJPmE)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Deep neural networks' ability to memorize parts of their training data is a privacy concern for models trained on user data. Yet, this privacy risk is not uniform across data points.
I'll first show how an adversary can identify a small fraction of "worst-case" training samples with very high precision (>10x higher than in prior work), by combining a number of ideas from the literature. Then, I'll introduce a new privacy-poisoning attack on machine learning models, that succeeds in re-identifying *any* training sample with high precision. Our new attack shows that against a determined adversary, the privacy risk of the average data point is similar to the risk of the worst-case data point.
I'll conclude by discussing how attacks can be used to audit the correctness of differential privacy defenses.<br><br>**Bio:** Florian Tramèr is a visiting researcher at Google Brain and an assistant professor of computer science at ETH Zurich.

Learning Binary Code Representations for Security Applications

By reducing a binary code with complex control-flow and data-flow dependencies into a numeric vector using deep learning techniques, we convert complex binary code detection and search problems into the search of embeddings, which can be done in O(1) time and often can achieve even higher accuracy than traditional methods. In this talk, I am going to show how we can revolutionize several security applications using this approach, including vulnerability search, malware variant detection, and binary diffing.<br><br>**Bio:** Dr. Heng Yin is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Riverside.

Tackling Data Silos with Synthetic Data  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/dnFa92daKxA)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Organizations are often unable to share data due to regulatory, business, and privacy concerns. The resulting data silos seriously inhibit the development, tuning, testing, and auditing of data science pipelines. In this talk, I will discuss the promise and challenges of using synthetic data from deep generative models to share data across institutional boundaries, thereby mitigating data silos. I will focus on a case study from the networking and security domain, in which we produce synthetic network traces using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We study key challenges related to the fidelity, privacy, and interpretability of the synthetic data. Doing so involves both system design and addressing fundamental learning challenges for GANs. Ultimately, we demonstrate NetShare, a synthetic data generator for network packet header traces; NetShare matches microbenchmark distributions in real data 40% better than baselines, while also enabling synthetic data users to train models for downstream tasks.

Online Deception in the Age of Machine Learning  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/00WeMyk24tg)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) is in the process of reshaping the ways in which users consume content and interact with each other on the Internet. At the same time, ML’s ability to generate and manipulate media content also revolutionizes how attackers run deceptive campaigns to manipulate public options and perform social engineering attacks. In this talk, I will describe our recent efforts to understand the emerging threat vectors introduced by machine learning algorithms and study how they would affect users. First, I will talk about how machine learning can be used to subvert common tools designed for cybercrime forensics and tracing sources of misinformation, using perceptual hashing tools as an example. Second, I will share our study results to understand how users perceive (and establish trust towards) algorithm-generated online personas in the social engineering context and examine the effectiveness of potential intervention strategies. Finally, I will discuss the open questions in combating online deception and the role that machine learning can play to strengthen our defenses.<br><br>**Bio:** Gang Wang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Privacy-preserving ML and decisions-making: uses and unintended disparate effects  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/RRvG9As8q6s)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Since its conception, differential privacy (DP) has become an important privacy-enhancing technology for private analysis tasks. Several private companies and federal agencies are rapidly developing their implementation of DP, including the notable adoption by the US Census Bureau for their 2020 release. Importantly, the DP data or models released do not live in a vacuum. They are often used to make important policy decisions with significant societal and economic impacts for the involved individuals. For example, US census data users rely on the decennial census data to apportion congressional seats, allocate a multi-trillion budget, and distribute critical resources to states and jurisdictions. When this data is protected using differential privacy, the resulting decisions may have significant errors with disproportionate societal and economic impacts for participating individuals. In this talk, I will focus on the challenge of releasing privacy-preserving data sets for complex data analysis or learning tasks. I will discuss the impact that differential privacy may have on the fairness of a downstream decision process, analyze the sources of this issue, examine the conditions under which decision-making is fair when using differential privacy, and propose several mitigation approaches to either alleviate or bound unfairness. Finally, I will conclude with some open questions.<br><br>

Trustworthy Machine Learning with Both Differential Privacy and Certified Robustness  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/JCPK4wh-C88)]<details><br>**Abstract:** While deep learning models have achieved great success, they are also vulnerable to potential manipulations, ranging from model inversion attacks that attempt to infer sensitive training data from a model, to adversarial example attacks that create manipulated data instances to deceive a model.  In this talk, I will present our recent work on achieving 1) differential privacy (DP) to ensure privacy of the training data and 2) certified robustness against adversarial examples for deep learning models.  First, I will present a practical DP training framework for centralized setting with better empirical and theoretical utility (IJCAI’21).  Second, I will present a certified robustness approach via randomized smoothing for quantized neural networks (ICCV ’21). Finally, I will present a framework that kills two birds with one stone and achieves DP and certified robustness via randomized smoothing simultaneously.

Blind Backdoors in Deep Learning  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/TCBPX3CA5UQ)]<details><br>**Abstract:** We investigate a new method for injecting backdoors into machine learning models, based on compromising the loss-value computation in the model-training code. We use it to demonstrate new classes of backdoors strictly more powerful than those in the prior literature: single-pixel and physical backdoors in ImageNet models, backdoors that switch the model to a covert, privacy-violating task, and backdoors that do not require inference-time input modifications.<br><br>
Our attack is blind: the attacker cannot modify the training data, nor observe the execution of his code, nor access the resulting model. The attack code creates poisoned training inputs "on the fly," as the model is training, and uses multi-objective optimization to achieve high accuracy on both the main and backdoor tasks. We show how a blind attack can evade any known defense and propose new ones.

Advanced Membership Inference Attacks  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/Ud7-sSJTG2k)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Data Protection regulations, such as GDPR, and AI governance frameworks require personal data to be protected when used in AI systems, and that the users have control over their data and awareness about how it is being used. For example, Article 35 of GDPR requires organizations to systematically analyze, identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project, especially when it involves innovative technologies such as deep learning. Thus, proper mechanisms need to be in place to quantitatively evaluate and verify the privacy of individuals in every step of the data processing pipeline in AI systems. In this talk, I will define what data privacy is in the context of machine learning, and how it can be quantified. I will also present ML Privacy Meter tool that enables quantifying the privacy risks of machine learning models. The tool produces privacy risk analysis reports, which help in identifying data records among the training data that are under high risk of being leaked through the model parameters or predictions.<br><br>
The privacy risk analysis in ML Privacy Meter is based on membership inference attacks. In this talk, I present a formal framework to reason about such attacks, and introduce new powerful attacks that outperform the existing attacks and are designed to precisely quantify the information leakage through models.

The myth of the interpretable, robust, compact and high performance DNN  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/BZ3FDiXkP78)]<details><br>**Abstract:**<br>To-date, a discussion around the relative merits of different compression methods has centered on the trade-off between level of compression and top-line metrics. Along this dimension, compression techniques such as pruning and quantization are remarkably successful. It is possible to prune or heavily quantize with negligible decreases to test-set accuracy. However, top-line metrics obscure critical differences in generalization between compressed and non-compressed networks. In this talk, we will go beyond test-set accuracy and discuss some of my recent work measuring the trade-offs between compression, robustness and algorithmic bias. Characterizing these trade-offs provide insight into how capacity is used in deep neural networks -- the majority of parameters are used to represent a small fraction of the training set.<br><br>**Bio:**<br>[https://www.sarahooker.me](https://www.sarahooker.me)<br></details>

Adversarial Preprocessing: Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning  
[[Recording](https://youtu.be/kCKayHjZd3E)]<details><br>**Abstract:**<br>The remarkable advances of machine learning are overshadowed by attacks that thwart its proper operation. While previous work has mainly focused on attacking learning algorithms directly, another weak spot in intelligent systems has been overlooked: preprocessing. As an example of this threat, I present a recent class of attacks against image scaling. These attacks are agnostic to learning algorithms and affect the preprocessing of all vision systems that use vulnerable implementations, including versions of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pillow. Based on a root-cause analysis of the vulnerabilities, I introduce novel defenses that effectively block image-scaling attacks in practice and can be easily added to existing systems.<br><br>**Bio:**<br>[https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/sec/team/rieck](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/sec/team/rieck)<br></details>
