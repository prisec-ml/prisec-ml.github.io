**(Meta AI)**<br>Open-Source Libraries for Privacy Attacks and Differentially Private Training: Privacy Linter and Opacus<br>[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAqceuvqjIvEtaynqa4BZ22q0QSkNr9HYp0)] [[Live Stream]()]<br><details><br>**Abstract:** As the field of Privacy Preserving ML is advancing, it’s important that researchers and industry practitioners have access to state of the art tools for both research and application purposes. In this talk, we’ll discuss two open-source libraries for Privacy Attacks and Differentially Private training, developed at Meta AI: Privacy Linter and Opacus. We’ll do a deep dive into their capabilities, talk about code architecture and share some practical tips on applying them to a set of real-world problems.<br>
<br>**Bios:** Alexandre Sablayrolles is a Research Scientist at Facebook AI in Paris, working on the privacy and security of machine learning systems. He received his PhD from Université Grenoble Alpes in 2020, following a joint CIFRE program with Facebook AI.  Prior to that, he completed his Master's degree in Data Science at NYU, and received a B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from École Polytechnique. Alexandre's research interests include privacy and security, computer vision, and applications of deep learning. Homepage: [https://ai.facebook.com/people/alexandre-sablayrolles/](https://ai.facebook.com/people/alexandre-sablayrolles/) <br>Pierre Stock joined Facebook AI as a Research Scientist in June 2021. Previously, he was a PhD Resident at Facebook AI Research and ENS de Lyon and defended his PhD around "Efficiency and Redundancy in Neural Networks" in April 2021. His interests include Neural Network Compression and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning. Homepage: [https://ai.facebook.com/people/pierre-stock/](https://ai.facebook.com/people/pierre-stock/) <br>Igor Shilov is a Research Engineer at Facebook AI, working on applied research in privacy preserving machine learning. He is the lead developer of Opacus and has industry experience in building highly scalable ML Systems, including NLP applications, Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval Engines.

**Praneeth Vepakomma (MIT)**<br>Private Measurement of Nonlinear Correlations in a Distributed Detting<br>[[Slides](https://praneeth.mit.edu/)] [[Homepage](https://praneeth.mit.edu/)] <details><br>**Abstract:** We introduce a differentially private method to measure nonlinear correlations between sensitive data hosted across two entities. We provide utility guarantees of our private estimator. Ours is the first such private estimator of nonlinear correlations, to the best of our knowledge within a multi-party setup. The important measure of nonlinear correlation we consider is distance correlation. This work has direct applications to private feature screening, private independence testing, private k-sample tests, private multi-party causal inference and private data synthesis in addition to exploratory data analysis.<br></details>
