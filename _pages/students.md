**(Meta AI)**<br>Open-Source Libraries for Privacy Attacks and Differentially Private Training: Privacy Linter and Opacus<br>[[Zoom Registration](https://imperial-ac-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJErde6qqDsjE9BeCa0vxQPKnbpZjDZN0pY9)] [[Live Stream]()]<br><details><br>**Abstract:** As the field of Privacy Preserving ML is advancing, it’s important that researchers and industry practitioners have access to state of the art tools for both research and application purposes. In this talk, we’ll discuss two open-source libraries for Privacy Attacks and Differentially Private training, developed at Meta AI: Privacy Linter and Opacus. We’ll do a deep dive into their capabilities, talk about code architecture and share some practical tips on applying them to a set of real-world problems.<br>
